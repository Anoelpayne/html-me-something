       <p>The Pedaler's Jamboree (aka ped jam) is a 30 mile bicycle ride on the Katy Trail from Columbia to Boonville that takes place Memorial weekend. There are 3 stops along the way with food trucks, beer tents, and live music.
           Thousands of people from all over Missouri gather to ride. Bringing all different personalities together to make for a trliy memorable weekend. We ride rain or shine (and the occational tornado alarm). 2021 will be the 5th year 
           I, along with some of my favorite people, will have participated. It is my <b>ABSOLUTE FAVORITE TIME OF YEAR!</b> And I am excited to show you why!    
       </p>

        <p>30 miles later and we are sore, tired, and pretty much giddy with pride and excitement. When we arrive in Boonville our camping gear is there waiting for us. After we set up our tents, it's time to head down to the main field and refresh our drinks and order dinner from a food truck. There is a main stage with <b>EVEN MORE LIVE MUSIC</b> and the best fireworks show I've ever seen!!</p>
